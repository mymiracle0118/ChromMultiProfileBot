# Multi Chrome Profiles Generator
### This React app allows you to create and delete multiple Chrome profiles with specific extensions and settings such as bookmarks, appearance, avatar images, and more.

## `Features`
`Importing`
* Import existing Chrome profiles using `Import.exe` in the root folder.

* To create new multi profiles:

Click the `Save` button to generate a file that contains a profile list. The file will be saved in the download folder. Note that the generated file must have the basic index name (e.g., `Local State.json`(true), `Local State (1)`.json(false)).
To clear incorrect files, run `Clear.exe` in the root folder.
Close all Chrome browsers and run `Store.exe` in the root folder to store the created profiles.
Open your Chrome browser to verify that the created profiles are available.
